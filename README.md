# ui-challenge-2

Use good HTML structure to scaffold this site, of course, using semantic elements where possible.
If you want, use SMACSS-style modularity to organize your CSS; there are no specific requirements. Feel free to try an alternate system for organizing your CSS.
Style the page to reflect the comp image provided as closely as possible; but, feel free to leave out the paragraph of instructions.
You need not be concerned with responsiveness or mobile layout on this assignment.
There are no absolute right or wrong answers... just do your best.
